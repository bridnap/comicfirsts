  Hey!  I'm a huge comic book character fan (Spider-Man, and specifically the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane), and love reading the back stories and origins pretty much anything mainstream (Marvel and DC). So many of these characters are so well defined with such rich histories that you can tell by reading how important continuity is (with the exception of a retcon here and there).

## Site origins
<p class="message">
What I wanted to do with this site was to pull down the information that is difficult for me to remember:  namely first appearance in the comics of each character, second appearances, and what makes those issues so important to the collector.  Gather this data is a daunting task in itself, so the sites aim is not to overburden with detail, but just pull the data that is difficult for me as a collector to find, and in that hopefully help you as well.</p>

<p class="message">What I won't be doing is providing a lot of origin or synopsis content.  The Wikis, <a href="http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Marvel_Database">Marvel</a> and <a href="http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">DC</a>, are fantastic resources.  There are a host of sites that can do a better job of retelling an origin story within their communities.</p>
