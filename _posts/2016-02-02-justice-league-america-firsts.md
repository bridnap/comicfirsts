Justice League of America originated from the Justice League Society in the 1950's, but were introduced with the new name in the 1960's.  From their initial appearance in the Brave and the Bold, the JLA were an immediate hit, allowing the 7 heroes to have their own book in continuity.  

<h2>Justice League America Firsts</h2>

<strong>#1</strong> - The obvious first issue for the JLA, and always a collectible.  You'll notice from the cover that Superman and Batman are not pictured.  These two heroes actually did not appear in a lot of the early JLA books.</strong>

<strong>#4</strong> - Green Arrow, the character that has caused a nice reboot of DC properties in television lately makes his first appearance in JLA #4.

<strong>#14</strong> - First appearance of Atom in "Menace of the Atom Bomb".

<strong>#31</strong> - First appearance of Hawkman as a member of Justice League America in "Riddle of the Runaway Room".

<strong>#74</strong> - First appearance of Black Canary.  Sadly, she isn't on the cover, but there is a fight of the Supers on the screen.

<strong>#103</strong> - The Phantom Stranger with a debut inside and on the cover.

<strong>#105</strong> - The Elongated Man makes his debut.

<strong>#106</strong> - Red Tornado's first book.

<strong>#146</strong> - Hawkgirl arrives much later than Hawkman.

<strong>#161</strong> - Zatanna is introduced as a member of the JLA.

<strong>#179</strong> - An iconic figure, Firestorm, has his first appearance.
