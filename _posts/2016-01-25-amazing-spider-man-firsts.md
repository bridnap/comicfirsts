title: Amazing Spider-Man Firsts 
category: marvel
---
Spider-Man and specifically The Amazing Spider-Man is my personal favorite comic book of all time.   While other books have gone through many reboots and reiterations over the years, Spider-Man, for the most part has stayed consistently close to canon.  Of course, we cannot expect a character to never change and a reboot is going to happen from time to time (more so in the Modern Age).  Yet, these Spider-Man specific characters have developed into a true community over the life of The Amazing Spider-Man.  You can almost always expect Doctor Octopus or Vulture to be available to do something evil.  Mary Jane or the Osborns are never far from the central story.  And Peter Parker usually can be depended upon to have that old "Parker Luck" with his life and the women in it.  Below are some of the more important "comic firsts" for ASM.  We have the issue listed, and then a description of what makes that issue important to the reader and the colletor.

<strong>#1 - </strong>While Amazing Fantasy #15 is the official first appearance of Spider-Man, this is his first officially titled The Amazing Spider-Man.  Features the Fantastic Four along with the Chameleon.

<strong>#2 - </strong>So many iconic villains, but the Chameleon and now the Vulture debuts here in the 2nd issue.

<strong>#3 - </strong>Doctor Octopus, the absolute in villains for Spider-Man appears.  As the book says on the cover, "His most powerful Foe!".

<strong>#4 - </strong>The Sandman appears with a cover that shows just how difficult a villain he'll turn out to be.

<strong>#5 - </strong>Doctor Doom, the FF's worst villain makes his debut in Amazing Spider-Man.

<strong>#6 - </strong>The Lizard - </strong>One after another, the writers turned out timeless villains and The Lizard is no exception.

<strong>#9 - </strong>Electro appears with a scene on the front showing Spider-Man possibly defeated.  Love these initial covers that showed multiple panels on the front.

<strong>#10 - </strong>Not an iconic group of villains, but The Enforcers and "Big Man" first appear in #10.

<strong>#12 - </strong>The early books were always trying to unmask Peter, and this is the "first" cover to show it possibly happen.

<strong>#13 - </strong>Mysterio just had to appear on an labeled as the 13th.  

<strong>#14 - </strong>Green Goblin was Spidey's worst in the early years instead of Doctor Octopus and he makes his first appearance here (riding a mechanical looking broom).  Cover also features The Enforcers, Big Man, and The Hulk.

<strong>#15 - </strong>Kraven first hunts Spidey in #15 with the Chameleon showing up again.  Mary Jane is mentioned but not shown.

<strong>#16 - </strong>Daredevil appears for the first time in ASM.  It's the early years and he's wearing his yellow costumer.  The RingMaster is also part of the action.

<strong>#18 - </strong>Ned Leeds debuts as a character.  It's a long time before he becomes the Hobgoblin.

<strong>#20 - </strong>First book for The Scorpion.  Again and again, so many iconic characters in ASM.

<strong>#22 - </strong>You know who Princess Python is?  Me either, but she makes her debut here.

<strong>#25 - </strong>Mary Jane beat Gwen to the pages of ASM by a few, making her debut along with Smythe in #25.  You can't see her, but she's there.

<strong>#26 - </strong>The Man in the Crime-Master's Mask!  Eh, not a lot of love for him, but the book also has the Green Goblin on the cover.

<strong>#28 - </strong>Molten Man arrives along with Peter graduating.  

<strong>#31 - </strong>Peter's friend (nemesis) and future girlfriend arrive in the form of Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy.

<strong>#36 - </strong>The Looter?  Yep, he debuts in #36!

<strong>#37 - </strong>We've had the Green Goblin a few times already, but 37 is important because we get a small dose of Norman Osborn himself.

<strong>#38 - </strong><a href="http://comicfirsts.com/marvel/mary-jane-watson.html">Mary Jane's</a> important, so we have to acknowledge her second appearance.  We can see her this time.  Still have to wait 4 issues before we see her face!

<strong>#39 - </strong>First acknowledgment that Norman Osborn is the Goblin.

<strong>#40 - </strong>First origin story of the Green Goblin.  

<strong>#41 - </strong>The Rhino crashes into Peter's world for the first time.

<strong>#42 - </strong>An important for every ASM collector, Mary Jane's face is shown for the first time.

<strong>#46 - </strong>The Sinister Shocker as he was called on the cover, "jolts" Spider-Man in this issue.

<strong>#47 - </strong>Peter and Mary Jane go on an initial date.  Many think that it was Gwen all the time before she died, but it wasn't.

<strong>#50 - </strong>A Daredevil villain, Kingpin, makes his first appearance in this iconic cover design.

<strong>#52 - </strong>Being the middleman is a hard job, and that position was given to Robbie Robertson in this book as a go between for Peter and JJJ.

<strong>#56 - </strong>George Stacy, Gwen's Dad, arrives in this book.

<strong>#59 - </strong>It's not the first appearance of the Brainwasher that makes this book.  It's Mary Jane's first cover appearance that obviously makes this so highly valuable.  She beats Gwen to the cover by 2 issues.

<strong>#61 - </strong>While obviously appearing before, Gwen Stacy being an iconic Spidey characters makes her first cover appearance highly important.

<strong>#67 - </strong>Randy Robertson makes his initial appearance in ASM.

<strong>#73 - </strong>Initial appearance of Silvermane

<strong>#78 - </strong>First appearance of the <a href="http://comicfirsts.com/marvel/the-prowler.html">Prowler</a>.

<strong>#86 - </strong>First origin of the Black Widow.  This book is in my opinion why Amazing Spider-Man books are so valued and collectable.  They have so many origin stories for other important Marvel characters.  So many different tie-ins or introductions for the Black Widow types.

<strong>#96 - </strong>Marvel's first Spider-Man book to break out of the Comics Code Authority and not display the stamp in the upper right.  Drug use or abuse was not an approved storyline, but this story needed to be told.  The storyline continues through to <strong>#99, but only 96, 97, and 98 are without the stamp.

<strong>#101 - </strong>Initial appearance of Morbius.  

<strong>#121 - </strong>Not sure if you can call a death a first, but Gwen Stacy dies in this at the hands of the Goblin.

<strong>#122 - </strong>The "first death" of the Green Goblin. Some of these characters die so many times, it's hard to keep up!

<strong>#124 - </strong>A lesser known known villain, the Man-Wolf makes his initial appearance here.

<strong>#126 - </strong>The original Goblin died just 4 books back, so here we have his son, Harry Osborn, taking up the Goblin's mantle.

<strong>#129 - </strong>Initial appearance of The Punisher and The Jackal, although we know which one is more important.  Be careful buying this 
book.  Lion's Gate pushed out a copy that looks almost identical years later.  You'll only want the book that has The Jackal mentioned in the bottom right corner.

<strong>#194 - </strong>1st Black Cat or Felicia Hardy if you will.

<strong>#238 - </strong>First <a href="http://comicfirsts.com/marvel/hobgoblin.html">Hobgoblin</a> (Ned Leeds Iteration)

<strong>#252 - </strong>First appearance of the alien symbiote black suit

<strong>#298 - </strong>It doesn't seem to hold the value like it did, but this is a double first:  Todd McFarlane's first cover and the first instance of Eddie Brock

<strong>#299 - </strong>Obviously not to be far behind Brock, Venom appears in this issue, but only briefly.

<strong>#300 - </strong>First complete featuring Venom.  This is a highly sought after book because of the iconic cover designed by McFarlane, a design used in Spider books many times since (in fact the book right after this one).  It's also the 25th Anniversary of Spidey.

<strong>#361 - </strong>While the man that becomes the villain appears earlier, 361 is the first cover for Carnage.  Not as highly valued as the others, but still a great cover to have.
