title: Brave and the Bold Firsts 
category: dc
---

The Brave and The Bold is a comic noteable for being a base for DC to introduce characters without investing heavily in book titles of their own. If the characters took off, get them a book. If not, keep them as secondary characters or just let them pass on into comic book oblivion. The Brave and The Bold eventually became a Batman book full of team-ups with other DC characters and then finally just a Batman book by itself.
