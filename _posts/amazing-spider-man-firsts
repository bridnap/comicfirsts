Issue #86 - First origin of the Black Widow.  This book is in my opinion why Amazing Spider-Man books are so valued and collectable.  They have so many origin stories for other important Marvel characters.  So many different tie-ins or introductions for the Black Widow types.
Issue #101 - Initial appearance of Morbius.  
Issue #121 - Not sure if you can call a death a first, but Gwen Stacy dies in this issue at the hands of the Goblin.
Issue #122 - The "first death" of the Green Goblin. Some of these characters die so many times, it's hard to keep up!
Issue #124 - A lesser known known villain, the Man-Wolf makes his initial appearance here.
Issue #126 - The original Goblin died just 4 books back, so here we have his son, Harry Osborn, taking up the Goblin's mantle.
Issue #129 - Initial appearance of The Punisher and The Jackal, although we know which one is more important.  Be careful buying this book.  Lion's Gate pushed out a copy that looks almost identical years later.  You'll only want the book that has The Jackal mentioned in the bottom right corner.
Amazing Spider-Man Issue #194 - 1st Black Cat or Felicia Hardy if you will.
Issue #238 - First Hobgoblin (Ned Leeds Iteration)
Issue #252 - First appearance of the alien symbiote black suit
Issue #298 - It doesn't seem to hold the value like it did, but this issue is a double first:  Todd McFarlane's first cover and the first instance of Eddie Brock
Issue #299 - Obviously not to be far behind Brock, Venom appears in this issue, but only briefly.
Issue #300 - First complete issue featuring Venom.  This is a highly sought after book because of the iconic cover designed by McFarlane, a design used in Spider books many times since (in fact the book right after this one).  It's also the 25th Anniversary of Spidey.
Issue #361 - While the man that becomes the villain appears earlier, 361 is the first cover for Carnage.  Not as highly valued as the others, but still a great cover to have.
